# react-redux-friendlist-app
Simple react redux friendlist application.

### Usage

npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Linting

This boilerplate project includes React-friendly ESLint configuration.

### Using `0.0.0.0` as Host

You may want to change the host in `server.js` and `webpack.config.js` from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from same WiFi network. This is not enabled by default because it is reported to cause problems on Windows. This may also be useful if you're using a VM.
